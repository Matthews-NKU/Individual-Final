		<h1>Why You Should Love Winton</h1>
		<div class="paragraph">
			<p> Winton is a lover not a fighter. He wants everyone to get along and laugh. he loves silly jokes like “Anyone want to hear my favorite joke about the periodic table?” - Winton, truly promoting community and friendship
			Winton has also won our hearts in the OWCS (overwatch world championships) winning several with his teammates. He also saved Tracers life with his wonderful invetion the "Chronal Accelerator" which he made entirely by himself
